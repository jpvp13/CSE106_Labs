            <h2>Purpose of this site</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the first iteration of of this 'How-To' site that is geared for
                those who are new to streaming or those who want to see what new innovations
                there are in the realm of streamers. As the ability to stream becomes easier
                and easier for anyone to particpate in, I have compiled a range of information
                to help further make the search for equipment and components easier for research and find.
