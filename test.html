                    Welcome to the first iteration of of this 'How-To' site that is geared for
                    those who are new to streaming or those who want to see what new innovations
                    there are in the realm of streamers. As the ability to stream becomes easier
                    and easier for anyone to particpate in, I have compiled a range of information
                    to help further make the search for equipment and components easier for research and find.
                    <p>
                        On this page, a picture of my personal daily driver & streaming PC is shown! This site is supposed to
                        help you figure out what components are a bang for the buck they cost as well as one-stop-show for recommendations
                        on items such as desks, chairs, microphones and stream cameras!
